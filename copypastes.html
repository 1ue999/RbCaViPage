    <h2>Tactical Tarantula</h2>
    The Tactical Tarantula is a technique in which a spider is used to cause fear in an opponent.
    <br>
    An example of the use of this tactic can be found in the movie Home Alone, in which the protagonist, Kevin McCallister, uses a tarantula, which he inadvertently freed earlier in the movie, as a weapon against the burglars Marv and Harry.

    This is a Black & Decker dual temperature Heat Gun. It can output air at 750F or 1000F. It uses only 1350W at 120V, and if thatâ€™s not enough power to dry your hair, you may consider using it to strip paint, as that is what it was intended for.
