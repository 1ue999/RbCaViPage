When I started computers, I thought uhhhh……. I forgor (I was like 8).
I like computers. How do you like that?
Customizability is fun.
Changing the settings, changing what things do, fitting things together to solve a problem.
Making a program with completely new functionality.
Computers can do anything (with enough cpu and memory).
Scratch might have gotten me into programming (absolut power ofer the uhhhh the shapes moving around), but I've moved away into other languages (files streamingd).
Other programming languages can do the more things. SQL / Python / C / JavaScript.
I have big ideas and computer programming lets me make them even though it takes a ling times (40 years per month).
Imaginge filling 2 pages with an essay, I don't have that much to say (right now).

		i did a programming since like 10 (scratch and maybe some other block based things? (idk)).
		i learned python next (tutel + hello world i guess).
		i actually don't know how / what order i learned programming in, but i definitely got better.
