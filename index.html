	</p>
	<p>
		Here's my other pages (i have no style).
		<ul>
			<li><a href = "https://rbcavi.github.io">GitHub "home page"</a></li>
			<li><a href = "https://rbcavi.carrd.co">"Carrd" site (has most of the info i'll put here eventually (go there))</a></li>

	</p>
	<p>
		i have a discord though, it's rbcavi. (and an alt, find it for imaginary points)
		i also have a <a href = "https://discord.gg/qE5cf3w6cD">server</a>. (i'm trying to make software)
	</p>

		Programs:
		<ul>
			<li><a href = "https://rbcavi.github.io/FRCCards">FRC::Cards</a> - i was involved in FRC for one season and i saw someone made cards, so i made a generator. (it was hard to make because i drew everything with primitives) it doesn't work for everyone for some reason.</li>
			<li><a href = "https://rbcavi.github.io/factorio-viewer/viewer.html">Factorio Viewer</a> - it has the icons and data for every item and recipe in a few modpacks.</li>
		</ul>
